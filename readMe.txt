We are a team that aims to automate driving more and more. In this project, we are writing a traffic sign detector that can be used in various devices such as smart glasses and smart vehicle displays. Although our aim at this step is to recognize traffic signs from visuals, our project has the potential to be developed. The traffic sign in an image taken from the vehicle camera can be detected and the driver can be informed. In the improved versions, this information can be recorded and this information can be given from the device memory when the traffic sign is too far away to be seen or cannot be read for any reason. Our main goal is to make our driving experience the safest and most comfortable.
